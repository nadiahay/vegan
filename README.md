# Animal Voice

Hi! Welcome to Animal Voice!

### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FiWkQzQjxA

### Description:

I think in 100 years we'll look back at our current inhumane treatment of animals and be horrified. I'm trying to make a difference by creating a tool that will help people make more informed decisions about what they eat. I'm also trying to make it easier for people to find vegan alternatives to their favorite foods.

Animal Voice is about giving a voice to the ones that don't have one: Animals.
