<h1>Why veganism is morally correct</h1>
<p>
  Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products,
  particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity
  status of animals. Veganism is a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far
  as is possible and practical, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to,
  animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.
